      Infections that are largely spread through sexual contact are known as
      sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), also referred to as sexually
      transmitted infections (STIs). They may be brought on by fungus, viruses,
      parasites, or bacteria. Here are some general stats on STDs. Vaginal,
      anal, and oral sex are just a few of the sexual activities that might
      spread STDs. In addition to sexual contact, some STDs can also be spread
      through non-sexual activities including sharing needles or coming into
      contact with bodily fluids that are contaminated. Safe sex practices are
      the most effective STD prevention strategy. This entails constantly and
      correctly using condoms, becoming immunized against diseases like HPV and
      hepatitis B, and undergoing routine checkups and STD screens if you engage
      in sexual activity. Additionally, it's crucial to avoid sharing needles or
      other drug paraphernalia and to have open and honest conversations with
      sexual partners regarding sexual health.
